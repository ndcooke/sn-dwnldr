 Original GitHub: (thepunkgeet/sn-dwnldr)[https://github.com/thepunkgeek/sn-dwnldr]
 Forked Author: ndcooke aka ndcooke  
 Forked Updates:  
 * Changed from Python 2.x to 3.x (mainly just changing print commands).
 * Will backport the updates to Python 2.x just in case with a different file
 name.
 * Changed to work better with a Windows file system.
 * Added a variable for the maximum podcast to download (last_episode)
 * Will probably add more later.
 
 Usage:  
 * Adjust `save_directory` variable to where you want the files downloaded.
 * Adjust `last_episode` to coincide with the last episode of Security Now you
 want downloaded.  If you don't know and want them all, look [here](https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm) 
 and check what episode number the topmost episode is.

 I wanted to download all the security now episodes because I love this podcast!
 This script attempts to do just that...
 It's not the most amazing piece of code, but it's better than doing so manually lol
 The main problem with doing this is that the files get big, 
 and therefore this script will take hours to complete... 
 To compensate I've added a log, and made the script able to pick up where it left off.

 You must adjust save_directory to where you want it download to.

 You're welcome to use and distribute as you wish. I'd love it if you gave me credit.

 Enjoy!
