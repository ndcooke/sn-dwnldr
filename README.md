 I wanted to download all the security now episodes because I love this podcast!
 This script attempts to do just that...
 It's not the most amazing piece of code, but it's better than doing so manually lol
 The main problem with doing this is that the files get big, 
 and therefore this script will take hours to complete... 
 To compensate I've added a log, and made the script able to pick up where it left off.

 You must adjust save_directory to where you want it download to.

 You're welcome to use and distribute as you wish. I'd love it if you gave me credit.

 Enjoy!
